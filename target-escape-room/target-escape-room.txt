Beginning: It's finals week and you've spent the whole day studying for your microbiology final exam at 8AM tomorrow morning. After many hours of studying, you decide to take a late night trip to Target to de-stress and do some quality retail therapy. When the store is about to close you check, purchasing many things that you do NOT need. After you check out, you take a detour to the bathroom before heading home. You have a rather unpleasant time in the bathroom and when you finally emerge, you discover that the store has closed. You panic and head to the front door, only to find yourself locked in.
End: Once you've used the keycard to open the foor, you rush to your car and see the sun just starting to peek above the horizon. You drive as fast as you can to campus and make it just 2 minutes before your exam starts. 
Room: Front Door|On the front door, there is a note from the store manager that reads "Eric, the front doors are broken so they can only be locked/unlocked from the outside. The maintenance man is coming to fix it in the morning. If you happen to get locked in tonight for some reason, just use my keycard in the counting area of the checkout office to get out through the employee foor. You know the code. Thanks, Jessica. P.S. Check the lights." You scan the surrounding area and see that you can either head in the direction of the Starbucks, back to the Restroom, or view the Aisle Directory hanging on the wall next to the front door.|false|false|/FrontDoorNote.png|null|Restroom,Starbucks,Aisle Directory|null|
Room: Starbucks|The Starbucks appears like any other Starbucks, there's nothing too special about it. On the wall, there is a note labeled "Jessica's Order" which reads "Trenta Iced Latte, 5 pumps Caramel, 7 pumps White Chocolate, Hazelnut (just a splash), 4 extra shots, Extra Whip, Cinnamon/Caramel Garnish, Macademia Nut Milk, No Ice." After you finish reading the note, you notice a nearby door, which is locked labeled "Break Room" which has a keypad that appears to accept 4 letters.|false|false|/StarbucksNote.png|null|Front Door,Break Room,Restroom|null|
Room: Restroom|Back in the restroom, you can see there are things strewn areound the floor from the day, it doesn't look like anyone bothered to clean the bathroom today, which explains how you ended up in this mess. On the wall, there's a cleaning schedule, which shows that the cleaning crew regularly comes in on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.|false|false|/CleaningSchedule.png|null|Starbucks,Front Door|null|
Room: Aisle Directory|When you walk over to the Aisle Directory, you see a neat list of items and the aisles that they belong in. It contains -Makeup: Aisle 1, -Toiletries/Bath: Aisle 2 -Electronics: Aisle 3 -Salty Snacks: Aisle 4 -Drinks: Aisle 5 -Grocery: Aisle 6 -Home/Decor: Aisle 7|false|false|/AisleDirectory.png|null|Starbucks,Restroom,Front Door|null|
Room: Break Room|Once you open up the breakroom, you step into a dark room. After turning on the light, you see that there are lockers lining the edges of the room. There is a door labeled "Manager Office" inside the room There is also a fridge and a few couches in the breakroom for employees to relax and eat while on their break. You see that all of the locker codes have 3 digit number codes, so when you see the one labeled "Jessica" in pink letters, you know that this must be the locker that Jessica talked about in her note. The locker takes a 3 number key on a combination lock.|false|false|/LockerRoom.jpg|MTWF|Starbucks,Jessica's Locker,Manager Office,Checkout Area|null|
Room: Jessica's Locker|Inside Jessica's locker, you find a industrial looking key and a shopping list. It reads "-Mascara -Dr. Pepper -Deodorant -Rug for Office -USB Cable -Toilet Paper -Shampoo -Conditioner"|false|false|/ShoppingList.png|574|Break Room,Manager Office|Industrial Key|
Room: Manager Office|To your surprise, Jessica's office is not locked. Inside, you see a small room - basically a closet with a small desk with an ancient computer on it. There's not much else in the room, just some inspirational quotes hung crookedly on the dingy walls and a small shelf with a collection of assorted colored Starbucks tumblrs. When you turn on the computer, you discover that it's looking for a password. The computer pops up a password hint, which says "aisle numbers" and seems to be asking for a 8 digit number.|false|false|/office.png|null|Computer,Break Room,Jessica's Locker,Checkout Area|null|
Room: Computer|Once you have unlocked Jessica's computer, you can see that she has little reminders all over her desktop background which remind her of certain things, for example: -Have Carl take out the trash -Reschedule Maya's days, she can't work Saturdays -Counting Room Passcode: 9996352|false|false|/computer.png|15273222|Manager Office,Checkout Office,Starbucks,Front Door,Restroom|null|
Room: Checkout Area|You enter the checkout area now that you have the passcode to the counting room. Except, you didn't realize the checkout office would be locked. In the checkout area, the lights on aisles 2,6, and 13 are on, which is odd considering the store is closed.|false|false|/lights.png|null|Manager Office,Starbucks,Break Room,Front Door,Restroom,Checkout Office|null|
Room: Checkout Office|Once you get into the checkout office, you can see it: The counting room door. You see that it requries a passcode and a key.|false|false|/checkoutOffice.png|2613|Checkout Area,Counting Room|null|
