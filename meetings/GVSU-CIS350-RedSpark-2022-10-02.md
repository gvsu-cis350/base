## Discussion points:
* Will we give the user an option to select the type of car they have and base their solutions off of that?
* Maybe have the user use a search bar and have the app base the solutions off of key words.
* Put filters on the results for "most liked", "most relevent"(likes, views), "newest/oldest".

## Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
* (This week we will start the project together then figure out responsibility's next week.)
* Start the project :) 
* Get a base template of how the app will look.
* Get a working simple diognosis that an user can search for and get a result.
