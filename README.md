# Defective Trolls

## Project description

Our project is a hack n slash type of roguelike game. We are thinking of making the game a futuristic themed game, the user will start with a weapon and have to venture to upgrade that weapon. We hope to add NPC's to talk and trade with, an inventory to interact with items that are found or gathered, a place to upgrade your weapon, and a place to craft things (probably healing, strength, or possibly speed potions).
