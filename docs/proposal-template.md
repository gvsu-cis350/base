# Introduction
* Our project will be a car diognostics app that allows the user to input an issue that is happening based on sight, smell, feel, sound, 
and if it won't start. Based on what the user clicks on, they will be brought to a list of solutions posted by other users. For example, 
the user will open the app, choose the option of sight, smell, feel, or sounds. If they choose "smells like" that would bring you to a list 
of possible smells, which then takes them to a solutions page. 

* The user will also be able to then input their own solution that can be "upvoted"/"downvoted" within the app.
* (In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies
* (What technologies are needed to build this project)
* Laptop
* xcode or another software that can be coded with swift.
* Potentially get it to work on our phones.

# Method/Approach
* (What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
* We are planning on using xcode with swift to develop a Car diognostics app.

# Estimated Timeline
* (Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

* Every week focus on one goal and create a list of ideas that need to be imlpemented.
* Configure a prototype.
* Choose a design.
* Develop the app and its behind the scenes knowledge.
* Go through testing of the app.
* Then finally release/turn in project.

# Anticipated Problems
* (Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

* Learning Swift
